        <h1> Sights </h1>
        <p>Australia is a fantasy land. From the hallowed traditions of the Aboriginal Dreamtime, when the great spirits conjured the coral reefs, rainforests, and red deserts, to armchair travelers who identify Australia as their ideal trip, Australia is deserving of all the attention. Australia, the world's smallest continent and biggest island, is about the same size as the United States, but with a population the size of New York State and some of the world's strangest animals.
            When most people think of Sydney, Australia, they think of the Opera House. This landmark skyscraper on Sydney's Bennelong Point is shaped like enormous shells or billowing sails.
            
        <a> Uluru (previously Ayers Rock) is one of Australia's most photographed natural marvels, located deep in the country's Red Centre. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, a World Heritage Site jointly maintained by Parks Australia and the traditional proprietors, the Aangu people, is home to the spectacular red monolith. 
            When you combine bronzed bodies, blond sand, backpackers, and surf, you get one of the world's most famous beaches. Bondi Beach is a terrific place to get a taste of Sydney's beach culture, and it's only 15 minutes by car from the city center. On a hot summer day, relax on the golden sands, surf the breakers, or cool down in the pool (but remain between the flags).<a>
