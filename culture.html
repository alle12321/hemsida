        <h1> Culture </h1>
        <p>Indigenous societies have long associated music and song with unbroken traditions extending back thousands of years. All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures use music in ceremonies and key communal activities. Aboriginal songmen are esteemed keepers of the songs that symbolize each community's rich and different oral traditions.

           Rugby league football has a place in the hearts of certain Sydney residents as a sport and a heritage. This dates back to the city's early colonial days, when the city and its culture were largely dictated by wealthy Englishmen who traditionally played and supported the Rugby code of football, which was widely advertised and passed on to the people of Sydney, including the working class, who largely played soccer back in England.
            
        Cricket is Australia's most popular sport since it is played all year. The game is also thrilling since it needs skill and cooperation. Cricket is also an excellent spectator sport since it is played at ground level, making it easy for spectators to watch the action.
